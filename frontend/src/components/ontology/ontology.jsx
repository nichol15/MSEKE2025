                        <p>The MSEKE curriculum knowledge map organizes concepts into a hierarchical tree. To incorporate an additional 
                        layer of useful information, each hierarchical relation is categorized by the type of relation, which is labelled 
                        by different colours in the map. There are six relations found in the concept map, and they are described on this page.</p>

                                <h1 style={{color: "#f79d65"}}>Subset</h1>
                                <p>subset(X, Y) := Y is a subset of X</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Y is a type of X</li>
                                    <li>X is an explicit description of Y</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>By modelling conceptual ideas into sets, concepts can be hierarchically organized by sets. 
                                To illustrate, consider the concept of functions in mathematics. Instead of defining functions as 
                                a mathematical object, it is defined as the set of all functions.</p> 
                                
                                <p>Other examples are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The set of all polynomial functions</li>
                                    <li>The set of all vector fields</li>
                                    <li>The set of all graphing techniques</li>
                                    <li>The set of all phase diagrams</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Some concepts by nature are sets, or more precisely, an explicit description of a set through
                                enumeration. Some examples are: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Laws of Thermodynamics</li>
                                    <li>Crystal Families</li>
                                    <li>Periodic Table Groups</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>With the concepts modeled in this way, the subset relation is defined naturally. The subset relation 
                                describes a broader than, narrower than relation where the parent class is a set, and the child class is 
                                either an element, or a subset of the set. </p>
                                
                            </div>
                            <div className='relation-section' id='constitution'>
                                <h1 style={{color: "#ef233c"}}>Parthood</h1>
                                <p>constitution(X, Y) := X constitutes of Y</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Y is made of X</li>
                                    <li>Y is a part of X</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When analyzing physical matter, which is especially common in materials science, we are often concerned with 
                                what matter is made of. This is captured using the constitution relation. </p>
                    
                                <p>This relation may be considering physical matter for instance:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A house is made of bricks</li>
                                    <li>A person is made of cells</li>
                                    <li>A wheel is a part of a car</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The made-of use case of the relation is limited to physical matter, however the part-of use case 
                                could also consider conceptual parthood as well. For instance:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Elements are part of the periodic table</li>
                                    <li>Dates are part of a calendar</li>
                                    <li>Words are part of a sentence</li>
                                    <li>x-axis is part of a graph</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                            </div>
                            <div className='relation-section' id='subtopic'>
                                <h1 style={{color: "#99d98c"}}>Subtopic</h1>
                                <p>subtopic(X, Y) :=  Y is a subtopic of X</p>
                              
                                <p>The format of information grouped into chapters in textbooks, or modules in courses has been a historically widely used organization of information. The relation seen is where a topic branches into various sub topics, which are generally related, but more specific than the overarching topic. The subtopic relation is most often used in the high level with broad topics. For instance the topic of calculus would have subtopics such as functions, limits, integrals, differential equations etc. Since it is not formally axiomatized, this relation carries less information than others, however it is useful for grouping information in meaningful ways.</p>

                            <div className='relation-section' id='characterize'>
                                <h1 style={{color: "#c77dff"}}>Characterize</h1>
                                <p>characterized(X, Y) := Y is an attribute, or family of attributes of X</p>
                                
                                <p>The properties of a concept have a key importance in describing that concept. It is especially relevant 
                                in material science, as any material has a set of attributes which describe it. </p>
                            
                                <p>The characterized relation describes the attributes of a concept, where the child class is either directly 
                                an attribute (a property that is true all the time) or an attribute set, which is a variable that can take 
                                on either discrete or continuous values. The discrete attribute sets are a set of discrete options, and the 
                                continuous attribute sets can take on infinite values.</p>
                           
                                <p>Since there are often many related attributes, which can be bundled into groups, the use of the subset 
                                relation may be used within the characterize child class. </p>
                     
                                <p>To make the attribute set relation clear, the child class which is considered the attribute set is coloured 
                                differently, with a dashed border. This cue means that the particular concept is an attribute set describing 
                                the parent. </p>
                     
                                <p>It could either be the direct part children relationship:</p>

                                    <li>characterize(person, <strong>eye colour</strong>)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>or transitively as in:</p>

                                    <li>characterize(univariate-function, characteristics)</li>

                                </ul>       
                                <p>The bolded concepts are considered the attribute sets</p>

                                <p>This relation is also modeled after the format of a textbook, where scientific or mathematical 
                                theorems are highlighted as important points in the textbook. Since this is a prominent aspect of course 
                                content, it deserved its own relation. The relation is not formally axiomatized, similarly to the subtopic 
                                relation, the concepts are loosely defined as related. The only restriction is that the child class must be 
                                a theorem or some family of theorems (like the laws of thermodynamics).</p>

                                <p>When considering mathematical formulas or rules, it is often useful to consider a first principles derivation of the formula.
